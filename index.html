          <h5>What is machine learning?</h5>
          <p style="font-size: 30px">
            Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, the main
            idea of which is that the computer does not just use a pre-written
            algorithm, but learns how to solve the task itself.

          <h5>Who teaches the machine?</h5>
          <p style="font-size: 30px">
            May be we? Maybe you? Both answers are wrong. The machine is
            learning on the data! They are called the training set.

            • In practice, the training phase may precede the algorithm
            operation phase (for example, face detection on a camera)

          <p style="font-size: 30px" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
            • But additional training is also possible during the functioning of
            the algorithm (for example, spam detection).

          <h3>machine learning methods</h3>
          <h5>Supervised learning</h5>
          <p style="font-size: 30px">
            One of the branches of machine learning. There are many objects
            (situations) and a set of possible answers (responses, reactions).
            There is some dependency between responses and objects, but it
            unknown. Only a finite set of precedents is known - pairs "object,
            response", called the training sample. Based on these data, you need
            to restore the dependency, that is, build an algorithm capable of
            producing a sufficiently accurate value for any object answer. To
            measure the accuracy of answers, the quality functional is
            introduced in a certain way. A teacher is understood to mean either
            the teacher herself selection, or the one who indicated the correct
            objects on the given objects answers.

          <h5>Unsupervised learning</h5>
          <p style="font-size: 30px">
            One of the branches of machine learning. It studies a wide class of
            data processing problems in which only descriptions of a set of
            objects (training sample) are known, and it is required to detect
            internal relationships, dependencies, patterns that exist between
            objects.

          <h5>Neural network</h5>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">
            It is a sequence of neurons connected by synapses. The structure of
            the neural network came to the world of programming straight from
            biology. Thanks to this structure, the machine acquires the ability
            to analyze and even memorize various information. Neural networks
            are also capable of not only analyzing incoming information, but
            also reproducing it from their memory. In other words, the neural
            network is machine interpretation of the human brain, which contains
            millions neurons transmit information in the form of electrical
            impulses. In fact, a neuron in an artificial neural network
            represents is a mathematical function of which some value comes to
            the input and the output is the value obtained using that the math
            function itself.

          <p style="font-size: 20px">
            SVM — is a linear algorithm used in classification problems and
            regression. This algorithm is widely used in practice and can solve
            both linear and non-linear problems. The essence of the work The
            “Machine” of Support Vector Machines is simple: the algorithm
            creates a line or a hyperplane that separates data into classes.

          <h5>Boosting</h5>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">
            The procedure for sequential construction of the composition of
            algorithms machine learning, when each following algorithm seeks
            compensate for the shortcomings of the composition of all previous
            algorithms. AT Over the past 10 years, boosting has been one of the
            most popular machine learning methods. The main reasons are
            simplicity, versatility, flexibility (the ability to build various
            modifications), and, most importantly, a high generalizing ability.

            Allows you to reduce the dimension of data, losing the least amount
            of information. Applied to many fields such as object recognition,
            computer vision, data compression, etc. The calculation of principal
            components is reduced to the calculation of eigenvalues. vectors and
            eigenvalues ​​of the covariance matrix of the original data or to
            the singular value decomposition of the data matrix.

          <h5>Anomaly detection</h5>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">
            In data analysis, there are two areas that are looking for
            anomalies: detection of outliers and "novelty". Like the ejection of
            "new object" is an object that differs in its properties from
            objects of the (training) sample. But unlike the outlier, it is not
            yet in the sample itself (it will appear after a while, and the task
            is times and is to detect it when it appears). For example, if you
            are parsing temperature measurements and discarding abnormally large
            or small, then you are struggling with emissions. What if You create
            an algorithm that, for each new measurement, evaluates how similar
            it is to the past, and throws out anomalous ones - you "fight
            novelty."
